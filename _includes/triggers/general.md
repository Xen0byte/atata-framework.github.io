**Trigger** - is an attribute containing some functionality that is automatically executed in response to certain events on a particular `UIComponent`. For example, when a click on button occurs it may be defined that a wait should be executed; or add page title verification upon page object initialization. Just mark control property or page object class with necessary trigger attribute.
