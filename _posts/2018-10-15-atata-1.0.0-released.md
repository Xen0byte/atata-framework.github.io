## Changed Behavior of FindSettingsAttribute and TermFindSettingsAttribute

The basic idea is to force all attributes to work in the same manner (`MulticastAttribute` with targets).
`FindSettingsAttribute` and `TermFindSettingsAttribute` had specific behavior before and were updated to work using new common approaches:

- `FindSettingsAttribute` is inherited from `AttributeSettingsAttribute`.
- From now `FindSettingsAttribute` and `TermFindSettingsAttribute` defined at class level without any target will apply to class where it defined, not children.
  To apply it to all children you can set `TargetAnyType` property to `true`: `[FindSettings(TargetAnyType = true)]`.
- Marked as obsolete non-default constructors of `FindSettingsAttribute` and `TermFindSettingsAttribute`.
  From now on use default constructor instead and set target attribute via `TargetAttributeType` property, e.g.: `[FindSettings(TargetAttributeType = typeof(FindByNameAttribute))]`.
- Marked as obsolete `FindAttributeType` property of `FindSettingsAttribute`.
  It should also return `TargetAttributeType` property value.
- `FindAttribute` should find `FindSettingsAttribute` at any attribute level.
  Formerly component level was excluded.
- `TermFindAttribute` should find `TermFindSettingsAttribute` at any attribute level.
  Formerly component level was excluded.
- Removed restricted `AttributeUsage` from `TermFindSettingsAttribute`.

## PhantomJSDriver Removed

Removed usage of `PhantomJSDriver` as it was removed in `Selenium.WebDriver` v3.14.0.

## New Report Property of PageObject<TOwner>

1. Created `Report<TOwner>` class that wraps `ILogManager` and duplicates its methods but with returning of `TOwner`.
   Is useful for reporting inside tests within a fluent chain.

1. Added property to `PageObject<TOwner>`:

   ```cs
   public Report<TOwner> Report { get; }
   ```

### Usage

```cs
Go.To<SomePage>().
    Report.Trace("tracemessage").
    Report.Debug("debugmessage").
    Report.Info("infomessage").
    Report.Warn("warnmessage").
    Report.Error(errorException).
    Report.Error("errormessage", errorException).
    Report.Error("errormessage", exceptionStackTrace).
    Report.Fatal(fatalException).
    Report.Fatal("fatalmessage", fatalException).

    Report.Start("Some section").
    // Do something within section.
    Report.EndSection().

    Report.Screenshot().
    Report.Screenshot("sometitle");
```

## New Image<TOwner> Control

Added [Image&lt;TOwner&gt;](/components/#image) control for `<img>` element.

## FileInput<TOwner> Now Handles Hidden &lt;input&gt;

`FileInput<TOwner>` is updated to handle hidden `<input>` as file inputs often made invisible/transparent.

- `Visibility = Visibility.Any` is set in `ControlDefinition`.
- `SetValue` and `OnClear` methods are overridden to handle visible and hidden inputs.

## Members of UIComponent That Became Public

```cs
public UIComponent Owner { get;  }

public UIComponent Parent { get; }

public ScopeSource ScopeSource { get; }

public string ComponentName { get; }

public string ComponentTypeName { get; }

public string ComponentFullName { get; }

public UIComponentMetadata Metadata { get; }
```

## Members of UIComponent<TOwner> That Became Public

```cs
public new TOwner Owner { get; }

public new UIComponent<TOwner> Parent { get; }

public UIComponentChildrenList<TOwner> Controls { get; }

public TComponentToFind GetAncestor<TComponentToFind>();

public TComponentToFind GetAncestorOrSelf<TComponentToFind>();
```

## ScopeDefinitionAttribute is Inherited from MulticastAttribute

`ScopeDefinitionAttribute` is inherited from `MulticastAttribute` to add support of advanced targeting functionality for `ControlDefinitionAttribute`, `PageObjectDefinitionAttribute` and other inherited attributes.
