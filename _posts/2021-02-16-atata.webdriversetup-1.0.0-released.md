**Atata.WebDriverSetup** is a .NET library that sets up browser drivers for Selenium WebDriver,
e.g. `chromedriver`, `geckodriver`, etc.
Basically, it provides functionality similar to Java `WebDriverManager`.

Check out GitHub repository for usage instructions: **[atata-framework/atata-webdriversetup](https://github.com/atata-framework/atata-webdriversetup)**.

## Features

- Sets up drivers for browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer and Opera.
- Supports Windows, Linux and MacOS platforms.
- Can download latest or specific driver versions.
- Can auto-detect locally installed browser version and download corresponding driver version.
- Caches the used driver versions.
- After a driver is set up, adds the driver path to environment "PATH" variable, which is consumed by WebDriver.
