### Fixes

- {% include issue.md id=438 type='fx' %} Negative `WaitTo` and `ExpectTo` verifications are treated like negative `Should` assertions

## New Behavior Attributes

New bahaviors added:

- Click *(see {% include issue.md id=421 %})*
- Double-click *(see {% include issue.md id=423 %})*
- Right-click *(see {% include issue.md id=424 %})*
- Value set *(see {% include issue.md id=425 %})*
- Value clear *(see {% include issue.md id=426 %})*
- Value get *(see {% include issue.md id=428 %})*
- Text type *(see {% include issue.md id=434 %})*

Now you can change the default bahavior of actions above with one of the provided alternative behaviors or with the custom one.
It should not be an often thing to change the default behavior, but for some UI elements in rare cases it can be valid.

## Editable Text Controls

### New EditableTextField&lt;T, TOwner&gt; Control

The new base `EditableTextField<T, TOwner>` control is introduced.
Similar functionality of `Input<T, TOwner>` and `TextArea<TOwner>` is extracted to it.
Both these controls now inherit `EditableTextField<T, TOwner>`.

New `ContentEditor<TOwner>` and `FrameWrappedContentEditor<TOwner>` controls also inherit `EditableTextField<T, TOwner>`.

### New ContentEditor&lt;TOwner&gt; Control

Represents the content editor control (any element with `contenteditable='true'` or `contenteditable=''` attribute).
This control is good to use for WYSIWYG editors.

### New FrameWrappedContentEditor&lt;TOwner&gt; Control

Represents the frame-wrapped content editor control.
This control is good to use for iframe-based WYSIWYG editors.

## New Trace Log Messages

Much more trace log messages are here to help you debug tests.

List of events/actions that are now tracked as trace log messages:
- Find element(s).
- Perform `IWebElement` actions: `Click`, `SendKeys` and `Clear`.
- JavaScript execution.
- Frame switching.
- Behavior execution.
- Trigger execution.

As before, you can configure log consumer to track only messages with log level `>= Info`, skipping `Trace` level.
{:.info}

```cs
AtataContext.GlobalConfiguration
    // ...
    .AddNLogLogging()
        .WithMinLevel(LogLevel.Info);
```

## New Log Sections Scructure

Hierarchical structure of log is introduced.
