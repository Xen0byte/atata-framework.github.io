[Atata]({{ site.links.atata_stackoverflow }}) tag has been created on Stack Overflow.
{:.lead}

<!--more-->

Thanks to [Dariusz Woźniak](https://stackoverflow.com/users/297823/dariusz-wo%c5%baniak) we have got [atata]({{ site.links.atata_stackoverflow }}) tag on Stack Overflow.
So now for common questions you can [ask a question on Stack Overflow]({{ site.links.atata_stackoverflow_ask }}) using `atata` tag.
It would be good to keep common questions, that can be useful for others, in one place.
Let's have Stack Overflow as a primary resource for questions & answers.

Anyway you can freely use [any of other sources](/contact/) for questions, issues, bugs, etc.
I try to keep an eye on all Atata sources and reply as fast as I can.
